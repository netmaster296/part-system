# part-system
An academic project from NIU; implements four interfaces for maintaining an auto parts retail company's online store and inventory

# Customer Use Case:
  Customers can browse a part catalog, add items to a cart, and go through checkout. 
  Pricing is determined by products and weight for shipping charges
  The NIU servers cannot process email requests, so no confirmation email can be sent.
  Customers place orders that are added to our database

# Administrator Use Case:
  The system administrator can search all current orders by date range, price range, or status
  The system administrator also sets weight brackets for shipping costs
